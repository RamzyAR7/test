## Overview

Monty is a scripting language interpreter that processes Monty ByteCodes files. This project aims to implement a set of opcodes for stack and queue operations, enhancing your understanding of data structures, algorithms, and C programming.

## Learning Objectives

Upon completion of this project, you should be able to explain:
- LIFO and FIFO concepts
- Stack and Queue data structures
- Common implementations of stacks and queues
- Use cases for stacks and queues
- Proper usage of global variables in C
